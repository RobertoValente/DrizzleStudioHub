# DrizzleStudioHub
Built for my personal use. Instead of use PHPMyAdmin, I prefer DrizzleStudio so... I create a HUB to store all my connections (locally ofc) and you can use it too!

# 🤔 Why I coded it?
- I prefer alot DrizzleStudio UI so I just created a project that ables me (and anyone) to store the credentials to a MySQL DB. Also, you can start the connection to a DB with just one click and access the DrizzleStudio to do whatever you want with that DB.
